## Added functionality
This section explains some of the less obvious or less visible additions to the Shell's behavior.

### Overview - keyboard and mouse shortcuts
|Shortcut| Description|
|--------|------------|
|`Shift + click on app icon in dash`                 | Move all windows of the application to the current workspace|
|`Secondary mouse click on the activities button`    | Open app grid|
|`Shift + Scroll`, `Shift + Page Up/Down`            | Reorder current workspace|
|`Shift + Ctrl + Space`                              | Open V-Shell *Settings* window|
|`Space`                                             | Activate window search with all open windows if *WSP (Window Search Provider)* is installed and enabled|
|`Ctrl + Space`                                      | Activate extensions search with all installed extensions if *ESP (Extensions Search Provider)* is installed and enabled|
|`Alt + Space`, `Super + Tab`                        | Focus dash so you can use arrow keys to select app icon and `Space`/`Enter` to activate it
 
 
### New buttons
|Button| Description|
|------|------------|
| *Close button in workspace thumbnail*     | Close all windows on the workspace. Default configuration requires double-click |
| *Trash button in app folder*              | Remove folder - move all icons to the main grid. Default configuration requires double-click |

### App Grid

#### Type to filter app grid
The default V-Shell configuration features a searchable app grid, allowing you to filter its content, including app folders, simply by typing when the app grid view is active. It delivers the same results as the default app search but without the constraint of the search view width. Additionally, V-Shell can search for apps by categories and keywords embedded in their launchers, making it easy to find all *system*, *game*, *internet*, or *video* applications. This functionality minimizes the need for manually organizing apps into visual categories.

#### Active icons in app folder previews
To enhance the efficiency of the application menu when using the mouse, V-Shell offers the *Active Icons in Folder Preview* option. When enabled, icons in the folder preview (folder icon) behave like regular app icons, allowing users to interact with them without opening the folder. V-Shell allows you to increase the number of icons in the preview from 4 to 9, as well as adjust the size of the app grid icons. This feature enables the folder icons to divide the main app grid into sections, with the most frequently used apps readily accessible while others remain hidden deeper within folders.

#### Open all apps in the folder at once
Simply drag-and-drop folder onto a workspace thumbnail to open all containing applications.

## Known issues
### Workspace navigation shortcuts
The default GNOME Shell configuration includes predefined shortcuts for workspaces oriented in both axis:
`(Shift)+Ctrl+Alt+ Arrow Keys`
and for horizontal only:
`(Shift)+Super+PageUp/Down`

The default GNOME *Settings* application only offers options to configure keyboard shortcuts for horizontally oriented workspaces. However, the `gSettings` configuration scheme provides keys for shortcuts for vertically oriented workspaces as well. You can access and configure these shortcuts using the **dconf Editor**.

When V-Shell is configured to use vertically stacked workspaces, the `(Shift)+Super+PageUp/Down` shortcuts for switching workspaces stop working.
V-Shell provides the option *Override Page Up/Down Shortcuts* to automatically switch the default `Super+PageUp/Down` and `Shift+Super+PageUp/Down` shortcuts for the current workspace orientation. If enabled, this option will move the shortcuts between following gSettings keys:
| Horizontal orientation | Vertical orientation |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| `switch-to-workspace-left` | `switch-to-workspace-up`|
| `switch-to-workspace-right` | `switch-to-workspace-down`|
| `move-to-workspace-left` | `move-to-workspace-up`|
| `move-to-workspace-right` | `move-to-workspace-down`|

Note that unlike the GNOME *Settings* application, *dconf Editor* allows you to add more than one keyboard shortcut to each action. V-Shell preserves all other shortcuts, only moves following strings between related gSetting keys:
- `<Super>Page_Up`
- `<Super>Page_Down`
- `<Super><Shift>Page_Up`
- `<Super><Shift>Page_Down`

The key order follows the order in which GNOME Settings stores the shortcuts. If you add the same shortcut but with a different key order, V-Shell will not recognize it, and you might end up with the same shortcut assigned to two actions.

### Compatibility with other extensions
V-Shell overrides parts of the GNOME Shell's UI code, and many extensions do the same, so conflicts are inevitable. V-Shell tries to mitigate the consequences of conflicts with the most popular extensions, which includes disabling its own modules. This means that some of V-Shell's settings may not function when conflicting extensions are enabled. V-Shell also provides manual control over its modules so the user can disable problematic ones if needed.

Please, report any incompatibility, you encounter while using V-Shell.

#### Incompatible extensions
- *Search Light* - You can achieve similar behavior by switching V-Shell to the *Static Workspace* *Overview mode*

#### V-Shell modules automatically disabled when conflicting extensions are detected
| Module                | Extensions causing module to disable |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Dash                  | *Dash to Dock*, *Ubuntu Dock*, *Dash to Panel*, *Dash2Dock Animated* |
| Panel                 | *Dash to Panel*, *Hide Top Bar* |
| Layout                | *Dash to Panel*, *CHC-E*, |
| WorkspaceSwitcherPopup| *WSM (Workspace Switcher Manager)* |

#### Extensions causing V-Shell to automatically delay its activation
to prevent crashes upon GNOME Shell starting up:
- *Dash to Dock*
- *Ubuntu Dock*
- *Dash to Panel*
- *Dash2Dock Animated*

You can enable this option manually if needed, using the *Delay at Startup* option on the *Misc* tab of the *Settings* window.

#### Extensions whose functionality is included in V-Shell
and should be disabled or restricted by the user:
- Partially *Blur My Shell* - V-Shell provides a basic settings for the overview background, including brightness and blur effects. If you want to use *Blur My Shell*, consider disabling its options for the overview, including app folders, to prevent visual glitches and inconsistency during transitions between overview states.
- *Alphabetical App Grid* - V-Shell provides much more options than alphabetical sorting
- *Grand Theft Focus* and other extensions preventing showing notification instead of immediately focusing the window that demands attention
- *Hot Edge* - V-Shell provides this functionality as an option of the `Hot Corner Position` setting
- Some of the *Just Perfection* options including notifications/OSD positions, hiding main panel, animation speed, dash icon size and more
- *Impatience* and extensions adjusting animation speed
- *Click to close overview* - V-Shell provides the `Click Empty Space To Close` option

## Installation

### Installation from extensions.gnome.org
The easiest way to install the latest stable release of V-Shell: go to [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5177/vertical-workspaces/) and toggle the switch.

### Installation from the latest Github release
Download the latest release archive using following command:

    wget https://github.com/G-dH/vertical-workspaces/releases/latest/download/vertical-workspaces@G-dH.github.com.zip

Install the extension (`--force` switch needs to be used only if some version of the extension is already installed):

    gnome-extensions install --force vertical-workspaces@G-dH.github.com.zip

### Installation from GitHub repository
The most recent version in the repository is the one I'm currently using and developing on my own systems, problems may occur, but usually nothing serious. The repository version may change often and doesn't updates automatically on your system. If you want to help me, use this latest version and report bugs.
You may need to install `git`, `make`, `gettext` and `glib2.0` for successful installation.
Navigate to the directory you want to download the source code and execute following commands in the terminal:

**GNOME 45+:**

    git clone https://github.com/G-dH/vertical-workspaces.git
    cd vertical-workspaces
    make install

**GNOME 42 - 44:**

    git clone https://github.com/G-dH/vertical-workspaces.git
    cd vertical-workspaces
    git checkout gnome-42-44
    make install

If you get `Can't recursively copy directory` error, take a look at issue [#51](https://github.com/G-dH/vertical-workspaces/issues/51).

### Enabling the extension
After installation you need to enable the extension and access its settings.

- First restart GNOME Shell (`ALt` + `F2`, `r`, `Enter`, or Log Out/Log In if you use Wayland)
- Now you should see *Vertical Workspaces* extension in *Extensions* application (re-open the app if needed to load new data), where you can enable it and access its Preferences window by pressing `Settings` button.
